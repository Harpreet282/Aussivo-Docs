title: DePIN Ecosystem & Governance
---

Aussivo is powered by a decentralized infrastructure network (DePIN) - where multiple roles work together to secure, scale, and grow the ecosystem. Each participant earns rewards and contributes to governance through the $ASVO coin.

## Key Participants & Their Roles

- **Node Operators**  
  Set up and manage compute, storage, or networking nodes to keep the Aussivo infrastructure running. They get rewarded based on reliability and performance.

- **Developers & Users**  
  Use services from the AI Marketplace on demand. All activity is transparently logged on-chain, with fair, metered billing.

- **Stakers**  
  Lock their $ASVO coins into validator pools to secure the network and earn staking rewards. Long-term stakers also help stabilize the system.

- **DAO Council**  
  Coins holders propose and vote on upgrades, fee changes, security policies, and more — shaping Aussivo’s future direction.

## Incentives & Governance Flow

- **Reward Distribution**
  Node operators, relayers, and service providers earn $ASVO based on uptime, usage, and quality of service (SLA metrics).

- **Staking Yields**
  Stakers earn from a mix of protocol inflation and platform fees — with higher rewards for those who commit longer and support network health.

- **DAO Proposals & Voting**
  Anyone can submit a proposal off-chain. If the community supports it, on-chain voting kicks in — and if approved, the system upgrades automatically.

- **GateSeal Emergency Switch**  
  In case of attacks or system threats, the DAO can quickly activate GateSeal to freeze upgrades or disable malicious validators — ensuring safety without central control.
