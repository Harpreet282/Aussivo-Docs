title: DePIN Ecosystem & Governance
---

## Participants & Stakeholder Roles

- **Node Operators:** Deploy and manage hardware nodes to provide compute, storage, and network services.
- **Users & Developers:** Access on-demand services through the AI marketplace; benefit from metered billing and transparent audit logs.
- **Stakers:** Stake ASVO in validator pools to secure consensus and participate in reward distribution.
- **DAO Council:** Governance body leveraging COIN-weighted voting to approve upgrades, parameter changes, and emergency responses.

## Incentive Flow & Governance Mechanics

- **Reward Distribution:** Node operators and relayers earn proportional ASVO rewards based on resource utilization, uptime SLAs, and network performance metrics.
- **Staking Yields:** Inflationary and fee-based yield distribution to stakers, incentivizing long-term network security participation.
- **DAO Proposals & Voting:** Off-chain proposal submission with on-chain vote tallying, culminating in automated protocol upgrades.
- **GateSeal Emergency Mechanism:** Rapid activation through DAO votes to revoke malicious validator keys or pause protocol upgrades in crisis scenarios.
