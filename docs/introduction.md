# Introduction


:::info Aussivo pioneers a decentralized infrastructure revolution :
an autonomous, blockchain-powered ecosystem delivering scalable compute, hosting, and digital services on demand.
:::

## Vision

**Democratize digital infrastructure** by enabling anyone to own, earn, and deploy services without traditional barriers.

> **"Powered by You. Built for Everyone."**

## Problem Statement

The current cloud and hosting ecosystem is monopolized, expensive, and inflexible:

**Opacity:** Businesses struggle to verify where data runs, creating compliance risks. Aussivo records every cloud resource on-chain (VM, storage, hosting), linking immutable proof of ownership to user wallets. Billing events, usage metrics, and lifecycle states are all transparently recorded.

**Vulnerability:** Cloud and Web3 applications face sophisticated attacks. Aussivo’s Security Agent submits periodic, on-chain security proofs, offering verifiable protection beyond traditional platforms.

**Blockchain Barriers:** High gas fees, complex wallet management, and fragmented infrastructure hinder adoption. Aussivo’s gasless transactions and unified marketplace eliminate these hurdles.


## Solution Overview

Aussivo bridges decentralized infrastructure with practicality:

**Transparent Infrastructure:** All resources governed on-chain—ownership, billing, usage, and security—across providers (Aussivo DC, AWS, Alibaba Cloud).

**Autonomous Security:** The Aussivo Security Agent performs scheduled scans (file integrity, malware, network anomalies, kernel modules, privilege escalations), signs results, and anchors hashes on-chain for immutable proofs. Enhanced Tier leverages AWS Trusted Launch and Nitro Enclave isolation.

**Web3-Ready Experience:** Gasless, wallet-free access via Gastank Protocol and a 1‑Click Blockchain‑Secured Marketplace.

**Fractional Ownership:** Democratized access to compute and hosting services.

**Deflationary Token (ASVO):** Powers governance, services, and staking with an EIP‑1559 burn mechanism.

**Smart Contract Automation:** Instant deployment of digital services.


## Architecture Overview
### SPoS Blockchain Layer  
Secure Proof‑of‑Stake with validator sharding and randomness-based selection ensures high throughput and decentralization.

### Core Components

**Validator Pools:** Stake ASVO tokens to secure the network and earn rewards.

**Gastank Protocol:** Relayer system sponsoring gas fees for users, enabling meta‑transactions.

**1‑Click Marketplace:** AI‑curated applications (LMS, ERP, AI, DApps) deployable without coding.

**Cross‑Chain Bridges:** Multisig and ZK‑based bridges for seamless token interoperability.

**Adaptive Security Layer (ASA):** AI‑powered Infrastructure scanning with on‑chain attestations.

**Enterprise Transparency:** All operations—ownership, billing, security proofs—anchored on the blockchain.

### Full Hosting Flow  
1. Connect Web3 wallet.  
2. Select service (Compute, Storage, Hosting).  
3. Choose provider (Aussivo DC, AWS, Alibaba Cloud).  
4. Configure resource and pay with ASVO or stablecoin.  
5. Provision resource; record ownership, billing, and security proofs on-chain.
