## SPoS Blockchain Layer  
Secure Proof‑of‑Stake with validator sharding and randomness-based selection ensures high throughput and decentralization.

## Core Components

**Validator Pools:** Stake ASVO tokens to secure the network and earn rewards.

**Gastank Protocol:** Relayer system sponsoring gas fees for users, enabling meta‑transactions.

**1‑Click Marketplace:** AI‑curated applications (LMS, ERP, AI, DApps) deployable without coding.

**Cross‑Chain Bridges:** Multisig and ZK‑based bridges for seamless token interoperability.

**Adaptive Security Layer (ASA):** AI‑powered Infrastructure scanning with on‑chain attestations.

**Enterprise Transparency:** All operations—ownership, billing, security proofs—anchored on the blockchain.

## Data Verification Flow  
Users → Relayers → Aussivo Blockchain → Nodes/Services → Output

## Full Hosting Flow  
1. Connect Web3 wallet.  
2. Select service (Compute, Storage, Hosting).  
3. Choose provider (Aussivo DC, AWS, Alibaba Cloud).  
4. Configure resource and pay with ASVO or stablecoin.  
5. Provision resource; record ownership, billing, and security proofs on-chain.
