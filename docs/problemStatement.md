title: Problem Statement
---

The current cloud and hosting ecosystem is monopolized, expensive, and inflexible:

**Opacity:** Businesses struggle to verify where data runs, creating compliance risks. Aussivo records every cloud resource on-chain (VM, storage, hosting), linking immutable proof of ownership to user wallets. Billing events, usage metrics, and lifecycle states are all transparently recorded.

**Vulnerability:** Cloud and Web3 applications face sophisticated attacks. Aussivo’s Security Agent submits periodic, on-chain security proofs, offering verifiable protection beyond traditional platforms.

**Blockchain Barriers:** High gas fees, complex wallet management, and fragmented infrastructure hinder adoption. Aussivo’s gasless transactions and unified marketplace eliminate these hurdles.
