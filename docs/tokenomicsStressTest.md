title: Tokenomics Stress-Test Scenarios
---

**Throughput & Scalability:** We aim to support high transaction throughput and will define specific TPS targets as the network matures.

**Provisioning Latency:** Our goal is sub-second resource provisioning; exact metrics will be established post-mainnet performance tests.

**Cost Efficiency:** We anticipate competitive cost savings over legacy clouds; detailed comparisons will be published after initial deployments.

**Security Proof Cadence:** Regular security attestations will be on-chain; the optimal frequency and SLAs will be determined based on operational insights.
